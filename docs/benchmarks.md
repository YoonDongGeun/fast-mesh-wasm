# Benchmarks

Reference results for `cargo bench -p fast-mesh-bvh`. Times are criterion medians and depend on the machine, so compare runs only on the same hardware.

- **Machine:** Intel Core i5-13600K, 32 GB RAM, Windows 11, single thread
- **Toolchain:** Rust 1.99.0, release profile (LTO, `codegen-units = 1`)
- **Date:** 2026-10-15
- **Meshes:** synthetic height fields (`terrain(n)` in `benches/bvh.rs`): 1,002,528 and 10,008,338 triangles
- **Options:** defaults (`max_leaf_size` 8, `sah_bins` 16, `treelet_size` 4,096)

## BVH (fast-mesh-bvh)

| | 1M triangles | 10M triangles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nodes / depth / treelets | 338,389 / 19 / 270 | 3,146,083 / 23 / 4,096 |
| Memory (`byte_size`) | 21.6 MB | 215.3 MB |
| Build, `Quality::Sah` | 439 ms | 5.23 s |
| Build, `Quality::Fast` | 115 ms | 1.70 s |
| Move 484 vertices, commit + update (refit) | 0.16 ms | 0.14 ms |
| Move 50,176 vertices, commit + update (refit) | 15.7 ms | 17.3 ms |
| Remove + re-add 200 triangles, commit + update (treelet rebuild) | 6.3 ms | 2.8 ms |
| First topology edit after loading (one-time array growth) | 6.5 ms | 55.8 ms |

Update times are steady state: one mesh and one BVH are edited repeatedly, as in an interactive session. Small edits cost about the same at 1M and 10M because they touch only the affected leaves and treelets. The first edit after loading a mesh is slower once: the store's columns and the BVH's arrays grow from their exact initial size, which copies them one time.

## How the defaults were chosen

`treelet_size` sets the cost of a topology edit, because every edit rebuilds the treelets it touches. Measured on 1M triangles (first-edit timing, before the steady-state benchmark existed, so absolute numbers are higher than the table above):

| `treelet_size` | Remove + re-add 200 triangles | Move 484 vertices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 65,536 | 29.6 ms | 2.4 ms |
| 16,384 | 17.6 ms | 2.1 ms |
| 4,096 | 8.9 ms | 2.1 ms |

The default is **4,096**: topology edits cost about a third of the 65,536 setting, while moves and builds are unaffected. Even at 10M triangles the top tree stays small (4,096 treelets).

`full_rebuild_fraction` (0.30) and `degradation_factor` (1.5) are kept. Moving about 10% of the vertices of a 1M mesh (50,176 of 502,681) refits in about 16 ms, against 439 ms for a full SAH build, so falling back to a full rebuild earlier than 30% dirty would be slower.

**Caveat: moves right after a topology edit.** Refits find the triangles of moved vertices through the mesh's incidence index, which every topology change drops. The first vertex move after a topology edit therefore rebuilds the whole index (about 14–19 ms at 1M triangles, measured during review; proportional to mesh size), so mixed move/topology workloads pay that cost once per topology change. The move benchmarks above are steady state and do not include it. Maintaining the index incrementally is tracked as a follow-up.

## Reproducing

```sh
cargo bench -p fast-mesh-bvh                          # 1M triangles
FAST_MESH_BENCH_LARGE=1 cargo bench -p fast-mesh-bvh  # adds 10M (needs ~2 GB RAM, several minutes)
```
